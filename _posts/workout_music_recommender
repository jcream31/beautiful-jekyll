Being tired of the continuous hunt to find new workout music to push me through at the gym, I sought out to pinpoint features of my current playlists and seek out similar songs using the Spotify API. The biggest challenges of this project for me was 1. building a dataset of newish workout songs and 2. working with an API that requires user authentication to access private data.   

To build the dataset, I built a recursive algorithm that utilizes the API's "find similar artists" endpoint. I considered that people like to workout to a variety of music, but the artists typically fall into the genres of hip hop and rock. Using 6 differnt starting artists ('Macklemore', 'Beyonce', '30 Seconds to Mars', 'Disturbed', 'Calvin Harris', and '2 Chainz'), I found their 10 most similar artists, and then those artists' most similar artists, etc. For each artist in the dataset, I used the "get top tracks" endpoint to populate the song database.  

I originally set out to derive my own audio features from the audio analysis of each song, but after dealing with the authentication issue mentioned above, I didn't have a whole lot of time. Instead, I opted to use features already available from the API including a song's danceability, energy, valence, acousticness, and instrumentalness.
